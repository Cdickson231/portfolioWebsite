<h1>Hi Welcome to my shiney new site. My names Chris Dickson, I am a self taught artist from Edinburgh, Scotland. A little about my self 
    I have always loved art and comics, Batman being my go to comic. From a young age I always enjoyed drawing and was always drawing on paperup untill I was around 19 -20 then i discovered Photoshop and digital art. Since then all i draw with PhotoShop. Recently I started a college course in HND digital Design and Development. In this course I have been learning more PhotoShop work (all on my Galleries) ive also been working on Web Development which brought you here. I've also been learning coding and some animation but  web development is where i see my career path leading.<br>This website is to show the skills I have learned throughout my 2 years (so far) at college. I have set up a forms page so you can get in touch with me about anything on the site or if you need any web development done.</h1>
